# Flight booking

To run the project please use `yarn start` command or `yarn dev` for developing, after `yarn install` of course.

You can also check the code with following commands:
- `yarn lint:ts` to check code with applied Eslint rules,
- `yarn lint:scss` to check styles with applied Stylelint rules.

## How it works?

After sending the form there is a random/fake result of API response - sometimes `error`, sometimes `success` to show both scenarios.

## Possible features in the future

- phone number mask,
- cities directory and autocomplete,
- multilanguage.
